## Project:Members-Only
In this project, we  built a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and register for events.Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like "Andy's House").

- Setting up the Back End
- Generate a new rails app from the command line
- Add
- Generate User/Event/EventAttendee model and fill out the migrations to get the columns you want.
- Create Forms ie SignUp, LogIn, Create Events
- Run the migrations
- Create Controllers for different models and their routes.
- Create Associations between different models.
- Add navigation links across the top to help you jump around.
- Modify Users shows page to separate those events which have occurred in the past ("Previously attended events") from those which are occurring in the future ("Upcoming events").
- Add tests for the models
